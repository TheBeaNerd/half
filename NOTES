  How about we experiment with some "simple" examples?

  It would be nice to see if the probabilities actually suggest "good" choices.

  Regarding shortest paths,

    The length of a shortest path from (a -> !a) that goes thru x must also go thu !x.
    
    If   (a ->  x) requires n steps
    and  (a -> !x) requires m steps
    then (a -> !a) thru x requires (n + m) steps

    Note: to compute this we need to track the shortest depth to each (x)

  My suggestion would be:
    o levelize the reachability sets
    o don't expand !x if you have seen x

  So, a fixpoint graph isn't the most useful for this.
